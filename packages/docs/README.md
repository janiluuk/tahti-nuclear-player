# Tahti Player Documentation

Tahti Player is a free, open-source music player without ads or tracking. Search for any song or artist, build playlists, and start listening. This documentation is for both users and developers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tahti Player is built on the Nuclear player project. The GitHub org and Mastodon handle below still point at upstream Nuclear where we don't run a replacement yet.
{% endhint %}
