- [x] **Visualizations** — ChannelView + analyser
- [x] **Broadcasting wizard** — Connect → Live → Multistream
- [x] **Email verify** — `/verify`
- [x] **Fan-tier editor** — Settings → Money
- [x] **Screen atlas on `/more`** — curated e2e thumbnails + Nuclear routes (`public/map/`, `ScreenAtlas`)

## Checklist (remaining)

Kept in sync with [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)'s "Remaining / partial" list, which has the up-to-date detail — this is the short version.

- [x] Full Three.js visualizer presets (ten distinct analyser-reactive scenes, lazy-loaded in the channel hero and ambient page background)
- [x] Stash share access (grant expiring read/download access + revoke)
- [ ] Sources OAuth callback-return verification (start URLs + mock-gating confirmed done; whether the callback lands on the SPA vs prod dashboard is unverified)
- [ ] Radio slots depth
- [ ] Multitrack timeline + press-kit polish
- [ ] Production cutover for `apps/web`

Done since last update (was listed here as remaining, verified shipped): channel chat hardening (hCaptcha + rail parity), Stash upload UI, Stats detail page, Venue register, Membership purchase, Password/account security (TOTP panel), board admin (22/22 pages, now `partial` not `out-of-scope`).
