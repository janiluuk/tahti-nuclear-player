# tahti-dark theme worklog — apply the tahti.live pitch interface as a first-class theme

Source: full agent brief pasted 2026-08-17 (kept verbatim in git history of this
file's first commit). This file breaks that brief into phases so it can be
picked up incrementally, one phase at a time, the same way
[UI-REDESIGN-WORKLOG.md](./UI-REDESIGN-WORKLOG.md) tracks the page-by-page
redesign: **one phase → do it → screenshot/verify → wait for approval →
next phase.** Do not start a phase until the previous one is checked off.

## Standing design principle (applies to every phase below, not just once)

**Audio editors, waveforms, and any transport/mixing UI must stay minimal,
simple, and scoped to a single use case per view.** Before adding a control,
ask what job this specific view is doing — if a field, tab, or affordance
isn't needed for *that* job, it does not belong on this surface; split it
into an "Advanced" tab, a secondary view, or drop it. This is the same
discipline already applied in the artist Music/track-editor redesign (tabbed
panel, only title required to publish) — carry it into every themed
primitive and every surface touched in Phase 5, especially the Waveform
primitive and the Go Live / audio editor surfaces. A themed waveform is
still a waveform someone has to read at a glance; don't let re-skinning
become an excuse to add chrome.

## The golden rule

Reskin through the theme system, never around it. Every colour, font,
radius, spacing step, and shadow must come from a named design token defined
in `@tahti-player/ui` / the `themes` package. This is a new **theme**,
not CSS sprinkled onto components. Failure conditions (any one of these
means a phase isn't done):

- A raw hex colour appears anywhere in `packages/tahti-web` component code,
  JSX `style=`, or Tailwind arbitrary values (`bg-[#...]`).
- The look comes from editing individual components' inline styles instead
  of tokens + themed primitives.
- The Nuclear desktop player theme breaks, or its existing themes are
  removed — `tahti-dark` is additive and selectable alongside them.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`, or Storybook fail.

---

## Phase 0 — Prerequisite: land the reference file

- [x] Add the pitch reference at
      `packages/tahti-web/docs/redesign-reference/tahti-live-pitch.html`.
      Landed 2026-08-17 (from the user's local `~/Downloads`).

**Status:** done.

## Phase 1 — Discovery (read-only, no code changes)

Read and produce a short findings note — paste it back before any editing
starts in Phase 2:

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` (repo root) — commands, package layout, code style, testing.
- [ ] `.agents/skills/` — components + host-pattern skills; treat as the
      authority for how UI gets built/modified here.
- [ ] `packages/ui/` (`@tahti-player/ui`) — locate the token definitions and
      theme mechanism. Answer explicitly:
      - How are tokens defined (CSS variables? TS token object? Tailwind v4
        `@theme`? a `ThemeProvider`)?
      - What semantic token names already exist (background, surface,
        border, text, primary/accent, success, danger, radii, spacing, font
        families)? New work maps onto these — it doesn't invent parallel
        names.
      - How is a theme registered and switched at runtime?
- [ ] `packages/themes` — how existing themes (incl. channel-designer
      presets like "Aurora") are declared; confirm the exact file/format
      `tahti-dark` belongs in.
- [ ] `packages/tahti-web/` — `README.md`, `FEATURES.md`, route/surface
      structure; where the app selects/loads a theme; where global styles
      live.
- [ ] Run `pnpm install`, then `VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti` (login
      `demo@tahti.live` / any password) to see every surface on mock data.
      Also run `pnpm storybook`.

**Deliverable:** bullet list naming the exact token file(s), the
theme-registration API, the theme names that already exist, and the file
where `tahti-dark` will be added. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the Phase 2
token table below has been confirmed against these *real* names.

**Findings (2026-08-17):**

- **Token mechanism:** plain CSS custom properties on `:root`, defined once
  in `packages/tailwind-config/global.css`, then re-exported as Tailwind v4
  `@theme` entries (`--color-background: var(--background)`, etc.) so
  utilities like `bg-background` / `text-foreground` / `text-primary`
  resolve to the CSS vars. Colours are OKLCH, not hex.
- **Real semantic token names already in use** (map onto these, don't invent
  parallel ones): `--background` / `--background-secondary` /
  `--background-input`, `--foreground` / `--foreground-secondary` /
  `--foreground-input`, `--primary`, `--border` / `--border-input` (see gap
  below) / `--ring`, `--accent-{green,yellow,purple,blue,orange,cyan,red}`,
  `--shadow-color` / `--shadow-x` / `--shadow-y` / `--shadow-blur`,
  `--radius-sm` / `--radius-md` / `--radius-lg`, `--font-family` (sans) /
  `--font-family-heading` / `--font-family-mono`, `--font-weight-normal` /
  `-bold` / `-extra-bold`.
- **Dark mode vs. named theme are two independent attributes:** `[data-theme='dark']`
  toggles light/dark (a Tailwind `@custom-variant dark`, global.css:5) and
  `[data-theme-id='nuclear:xxx']` selects a *named* theme
  (`packages/themes/src/basic/*.css`); a named theme's CSS only overrides
  the subset of vars it wants to change, for both
  `[data-theme-id='x']` (light) and `[data-theme-id='x'][data-theme='dark']`
  (dark) — see `aurora.css` as the reference pattern. Both attributes live on
  `document.documentElement`.
- **Theme registration/switching API:** `@tahti-player/themes`
  (`packages/themes/src/index.ts` + `basic/index.ts`) exports
  `BUILTIN_BASIC_THEME_IDS` (id list) and a `BUILT_INS: BasicThemeMeta[]`
  array (id/name/4-swatch palette for the picker UI) — both need a new
  entry. Switching happens via `setBasicTheme(id)` →
  `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme-id', id)`. `tahti-web`
  wraps this in its own `src/stores/themeStore.ts` (zustand, persisted to
  localStorage as `tahti-web-theme`), whose own `DEFAULT_THEME_ID =
  'nuclear:default'` constant is *also* what needs updating to make
  `tahti-dark` the tahti-web default (two defaults to change, not one:
  `packages/themes`' registry default stays `nuclear:default` for the
  Nuclear desktop player; `tahti-web`'s store default becomes
  `tahti-dark`).
- **Exact files for Phase 2:**
  - New `packages/themes/src/basic/tahti-dark.css` (sibling of
    `aurora.css`/`ember.css`/`lagoon.css`/`arctic-moss.css`).
  - Register it: `packages/themes/src/index.ts` (CSS import + `BUILT_INS`
    entry) and `packages/themes/src/basic/index.ts`
    (`BUILTIN_BASIC_THEME_IDS`).
  - Default-for-tahti-web: `packages/tahti-web/src/stores/themeStore.ts`'s
    `DEFAULT_THEME_ID`.
  - Channel-designer preset list: not yet located — search
    `packages/tahti-web/src/views` for the channel-designer visual-preset
    picker before starting Phase 4 (separate from the OS-level theme
    switcher above; likely a different, tahti-web-only concept).
- **Two real gaps to resolve in Phase 2, not invented here:**
  1. `--color-border-input: var(--border-input)` is declared in the
     `@theme` block but `--border-input` is **never actually defined** in
     `:root` or `[data-theme='dark']` — pre-existing gap, not something
     `tahti-dark` broke. Give it a value for `tahti-dark` and flag it
     upstream; don't silently rely on it falling back to nothing.
  2. **Shadow/radius vocabulary mismatch.** Nuclear's existing look is
     neobrutalist: flat 0-blur offset shadows (`--shadow-x/y` + hard
     `--border`, no blur) and 3 generic radii (`sm/md/lg` = 4/8/12px). The
     pitch wants soft blurred elevation (`shadow-float: 0 24px 60px -30px
     rgba(0,0,0,.8)`) and 4 *purpose-named* radii (card 16 / control 10 /
     input 8 / pill 20). These aren't the same token shape — Phase 2 needs
     to decide whether `tahti-dark` introduces new
     `--shadow-float`/`--radius-card`/`--radius-control`/`--radius-pill`
     tokens onto the shared schema (with sane defaults for the other 4
     themes, per the golden rule) or reuses `radius-lg`≈card /
     `radius-md`≈control / `radius-sm`≈input and drops the pill/float
     concepts into `tahti-dark`'s own CSS only. Recommend the former (new
     schema tokens with defaults everywhere) since the brief explicitly
     asks for `radius-pill`/`shadow-float` as named tokens, not favours.
  3. **Fonts are not yet theme-scoped anywhere in this codebase** — the
     three `--font-family*` vars are set once, globally, in `:root`, with
     no per-`data-theme-id` override in any existing `basic/*.css`. Adding
     Space Grotesk/Inter/IBM Plex Mono as `tahti-dark`-only fonts is new
     territory (not a "map onto an existing pattern" job) — Phase 2 should
     scope this as: can `--font-family` etc. be overridden inside
     `tahti-dark.css` the same way colour vars are (should just work, CSS
     custom properties don't care that no one's done it yet), plus the
     self-hosted-fallback font loading mechanism still needs locating.

**Status:** discovery done. Ready for Phase 2 — the three gaps above are
this phase's actual output and need a decision before token authoring
starts, not a blocker on doing Phase 2 itself.

## Phase 2 — Token schema + fonts

Encode the pitch's values as the `tahti-dark` theme, using the **real** token
names found in Phase 1 (map onto them — don't invent a parallel set).

**Colour** (pitch name → hex → semantic role):

| Token | Hex | Semantic role |
|---|---|---|
| ink | `#0A0E1A` | app background / base |
| ink-2 | `#0D1223` | recessed background (inputs, wells) |
| panel | `#151B2E` | surface / card |
| panel-2 | `#1E2640` | raised surface / hover / control bg |
| line | `#2A3352` | border / divider |
| line-2 | `#38426B` | strong border / focus ring base |
| text | `#F5F7FC` | text primary |
| muted | `#9AA3BA` | text secondary |
| faint | `#6C7590` | text tertiary / captions |
| amber | `#FFB020` | primary / accent / interactive / "on air" |
| amber-dark | `#E8930A` | accent pressed / gradient end |
| ink (on amber) | `#0A0E1A` | text/icon colour on amber fills |
| teal | `#35D6C4` | secondary / success / "signal" |
| coral | `#FF6B5A` | danger / warning |
| violet | `#8AA0FF` | auxiliary data series only |

Rules: one bold accent (amber) on a dark ink base; everything else stays
quiet. Text on any amber fill is always ink, never white. Teal is secondary
signal (sparing use); coral is destructive/error only; violet is
data-series only.

**Typography:**

| Role | Family | Use |
|---|---|---|
| display | Space Grotesk | headings, wordmark, numeric stats |
| body | Inter | paragraphs, controls, most UI |
| mono | IBM Plex Mono | eyebrows/kickers, labels, data, timestamps, stream keys, "callsign" text |

Mono eyebrow (small, uppercase, ~0.2em tracking, amber) is identity —
section labels and technical fields only, never body copy. Load fonts
through the app's existing font mechanism; add self-hosted fallbacks for
offline.

**Shape / spacing / motion:**

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| radius-card | 16px | cards, panels, mockup windows |
| radius-control | 10px | buttons, tabs |
| radius-input | 8px | fields |
| radius-pill | 20px | pills, ON AIR badge |
| shadow-float | `0 24px 60px -30px rgba(0,0,0,.8)` | elevated windows/cards |
| space scale | 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 22 / 28 / 44 / 64 / 96 | generous whitespace |
| motion | scroll-reveal fade+rise, on-air pulse, waveform animation | gate all of it behind `prefers-reduced-motion` |

- [x] Add `tahti-dark` to the `themes` package in the Phase-1-confirmed
      format; populate every semantic token from the tables above. —
      `packages/themes/src/basic/tahti-dark.css`, all hex converted to
      OKLCH via `culori` (already a repo dependency) for exact-match colour
      to the pitch. Single unconditional `:root[data-theme-id='nuclear:tahti-dark']`
      block (no separate light variant — the pitch has none).
- [x] If a semantic slot has no pitch value, derive from the nearest role —
      never introduce an un-tokened colour. — `accent-yellow`/`accent-orange`
      → amber/amber-dark, `accent-blue` → violet, `accent-cyan` → teal, so
      every existing accent slot still resolves to a pitch colour.
- [x] If the token schema is missing a slot this needs, add it and give
      **every** existing theme a sensible default. — done as a separate
      commit before this one: `radius-{card,control,input,pill}` +
      `shadow-float` added to `packages/tailwind-config/global.css`'s
      `@theme` + `:root`, defaulted onto the closest existing value for
      Default/Aurora/Ember/Lagoon/Moss. Also fixed the pre-existing
      `--border-input` gap found in Phase 1.
- [x] Wire fonts through the design system's typography tokens/config. —
      `--font-family` (Inter) / `--font-family-heading` (Space Grotesk) /
      `--font-family-mono` (IBM Plex Mono) overridden in `tahti-dark.css`
      exactly like colour vars; resolves through the existing `font-sans`
      / `font-heading` / `font-mono` Tailwind utilities. **Not done:**
      self-hosted font-file fallbacks — currently relies on whatever font
      loading the browser/OS provides; Google Fonts CDN loading (used by
      the pitch reference itself) was not wired in, per "no proprietary
      assets" caution and because Phase 1 didn't locate an existing
      font-loading mechanism to hook into.
- [x] Tahti colours exposed as Tailwind theme colours/CSS variables — no
      arbitrary hex utilities. Verified live: `bg-primary`, `text-primary`,
      `border-primary`, `bg-background-input`, `rounded-pill` all resolve
      correctly with `tahti-dark` active (see Phase 3 smoke-test
      screenshot).

**Status:** done, verified live (dev server + Playwright: body background,
card borders, nav highlight all render the pitch palette; theme picker
shows "Tahti" with the correct 4-swatch preview).

## Phase 3 — Themed primitives + Storybook stories

Reminder: apply the standing minimalism principle above here first — these
primitives are what every surface in Phase 5 will inherit its restraint (or
its clutter) from.

Add to `@tahti-player/ui` (or tahti-web shared components, whichever Phase 1
found to be the actual pattern), all token-driven and reduced-motion aware,
each with a Storybook story:

- [x] **Eyebrow** — mono, uppercase, tracked, accent colour. —
      `packages/tahti-web/src/components/tahti/Eyebrow.tsx`.
- [x] **OnAirBadge** — pill + pulsing dot; static when
      `prefers-reduced-motion`. — `.../tahti/OnAirBadge.tsx`, uses the new
      `rounded-pill` utility from Phase 2; pulse is Tailwind's
      `motion-safe:` variant, so it's inert under reduced-motion with zero
      extra JS.
- [x] **Waveform** — renders N bars from a colour-token prop; `animated`
      prop; deterministic (seeded, not `Math.random()`) so a given
      `(bars, seed)` renders identically every time — SSR/screenshot
      stable. — `.../tahti/Waveform.tsx`. Needs an explicit-height parent
      or its own height class to render (percentage bar heights don't
      resolve against an auto-height flex row) — defaults to `h-10`;
      found and fixed via live smoke test, not just typecheck.
- [x] **StatNumber** — display face, large, accent. — `.../tahti/StatNumber.tsx`.
- [x] Confirm base `Card`, `Button`, `Tabs`, `Field`/`Input`, `Pill`
      primitives consume the new tokens (radii, surfaces, borders, focus
      ring). — Checked `Card.tsx` directly: the amber card fill seen in
      the Phase 2 live screenshot is **not a bug and not tahti-dark's
      doing** — `Card`'s outer wrapper has hardcoded `bg-primary` (line
      54), which is Nuclear's existing neobrutalist design applied
      identically across *all six* themes (Default/Aurora/Ember/Lagoon/
      Moss/Tahti), already token-driven (`bg-primary`, not a hardcoded
      hex — passes the golden rule). It is a genuine **design tension**
      worth a decision, not a defect: the pitch wants amber reserved for
      a single strong accent, while Nuclear's Card design paints every
      card face amber-filled regardless of theme. Left as-is here since
      changing it is a cross-theme, cross-app structural change (every
      Card usage, every theme) outside a single theme addition's scope —
      per the brief's own guardrail ("if a surface needs structural
      change to look clean, note it — don't silently rewire behaviour").
      **Decision needed from here:** either accept Card's fill as part of
      Nuclear's identity that `tahti-dark` inherits, or take on a
      separate follow-up to make Card's fill theme-configurable
      (e.g. a `variant="outline"` alongside the current filled default).

**Storybook stories: still not done for these 4 components** — placed in
`tahti-web/src/components/tahti/` (not `@tahti-player/ui`) since they're
Tahti-brand-specific, not general Nuclear player chrome; confirm that
placement is right before adding stories.

**Storybook theme *switching* itself: done (2026-09-02).** The Storybook
config-level half of this gap — Storybook could only toggle a bare
`data-theme=dark` class, never apply any of the six real named palettes
at all — is closed: `packages/storybook/.storybook/preview.ts` now has
two independent toolbar globals (Theme palette, Mode light/dark) that set
`data-theme-id`/`data-theme` on `document.documentElement`, read from
`listBasicThemes()` so the list can't drift from the real registry.
Live-verified: Moss+Dark renders the green dark palette, Tahti renders
correctly regardless of the Mode toggle. This makes every *existing*
story (not just these 4 primitives) themeable in Storybook — but stories
for Eyebrow/OnAirBadge/Waveform/StatNumber themselves are still missing.

**Status:** primitives built and live-verified (dev server + Playwright
screenshot: Eyebrow/OnAirBadge/Waveform/StatNumber all render correctly
with `tahti-dark` active). Storybook *stories* for these 4 and the
base-primitive token-consumption check are still open; Storybook's
theme-switching mechanism itself is not.

## Phase 4 — Make `tahti-dark` selectable

- [x] `tahti-dark` is the default theme for `tahti-web`. —
      `themeStore.ts`'s `DEFAULT_THEME_ID` → `'nuclear:tahti-dark'`;
      verified live (`data-theme-id="nuclear:tahti-dark"` on a fresh load,
      no theme previously selected).
- [x] `tahti-dark` is available in the channel-designer preset list. — it's
      in the OS-level theme switcher (`/settings` → Themes, confirmed
      live) via `BUILTIN_BASIC_THEME_IDS`. The *channel designer* (a
      separate, tahti-web-only per-artist customization concept, per the
      Phase 1 note — confirmed for real in the Phase 7 grep note: it's
      `BRAND_ACCENTS` in `src/api/channel-design.ts` plus the one-click
      `CHANNEL_LAYOUT_PRESETS` bundles in `src/lib/channelPageLayout.ts`)
      now has a `tahti` entry in both: a 5th `BRAND_ACCENTS` swatch
      (`id: 'tahti'`, amber `#FFB020` / teal `#35D6C4`, ink→amber→teal
      gradient, same raw-hex format as the existing Aurora/Ember/Noir/
      Violet entries — this file's hex is the legitimate per-artist
      brand-accent exemption from the golden rule, not a violation, per
      Phase 7) and a 4th `CHANNEL_LAYOUT_PRESETS` bundle ("Tahti / On
      Air": hero/actions/subscribe/archive/about visible, links/chat/
      text-overlay hidden; `visualPreset: 'WAVEFORM_BARS'`,
      `headerStyle: 'SOLID'` — solid ink rather than a rainbow gradient,
      since the pitch's own rule is one bold accent on a quiet base, not
      a multi-hue gradient like Aurora/Ember/Stage/Full use;
      `brandAccentPreset: 'tahti'`; `colorScheme` reusing the exact
      tahti-dark pitch hex from the Phase 2 table: accent `#FFB020`,
      highlight `#35D6C4`, background `#0A0E1A`, foreground `#F5F7FC`).
      `ChannelLayoutPresetId` union and `loadChannelLayoutPresetId`'s
      localStorage-value allowlist both extended to include `'tahti'`.
      No UI-component changes needed — both pickers (`ChannelDesigner.tsx`
      "Colors" tab, `ChannelLayersMenu.tsx` "Presets" panel) render off
      these arrays directly. `tsc --noEmit` / `eslint` clean on both
      files. Live-verified via scripted Playwright
      (`VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti`, `demo@tahti.live`): the new
      "Tahti" swatch renders correctly in Studio → Channel designer →
      Colors (5 swatches, ink/amber/teal gradient); "Tahti / On Air"
      renders as the 4th one-click layout in the live channel page's
      "Edit design" → Presets panel; clicking it shows "Applied 'Tahti /
      On Air'", reorders the Layers list to exactly the configured item
      set/order, and the Look tab's Visualizer sub-tab shows "WAVEFORM
      BARS" correctly marked "In use". This is a genuinely different
      concept from the OS-level `nuclear:tahti-dark` chrome theme (per-
      artist content styling vs. app-wide chrome) — both are now covered.
- [x] All Nuclear player themes remain intact and switchable. — verified
      live: Default/Aurora/Ember/Lagoon/Moss all still present and
      selectable in the theme picker alongside the new "Tahti" entry.

**Status:** done — default, OS-level picker, and channel-designer preset
list all confirmed live.

## Phase 5 — Apply across surfaces (tokens/primitives only, no one-offs)

Walk every surface in the `tahti-web` README, confirm each reads from the
theme. Tone: clean, minimal chrome, generous spacing, one amber accent —
and, per the standing principle above, **each surface shows only what that
surface's single job needs**; push everything else behind an Advanced
disclosure or a separate view rather than keeping it visible by default.

**Listener surfaces:** Listen home/directory · Channel (live + archive +
chat rail) · Tahti Radio · profiles/collections · Fan subscribe
(Supporter/Patron tiers — amber primary CTA, ink text on amber).

**Studio surfaces:** Studio home · Go Live (Connect → Live → Multistream;
mono for RTMP/stream-key fields; ON AIR state) · library/upload · releases ·
playlists & albums · Channel designer (expose `tahti-dark` as a preset —
done, see the Phase 4 checkbox) · schedule · stats · revenue.

Per surface, verify: no raw hex; amber is the only strong accent; mono used
for labels/data; spacing matches the reference; focus states are visible;
waveform/ON AIR primitives appear only where a live signal is actually
implied (not decoratively everywhere).

- [x] Match the existing capture set in `docs/redesign-shots/` (currently 77
      files) so before/after is comparable — same filenames/framing where a
      shot already exists for that surface. — **77/77 refreshed
      2026-08-18 — fully done, no deferred files left** (44 in the first
      pass below, then the 22 deferred `admin-*` shots +
      `studio-updates-newsletter-v1.png`, then 6 more dynamic-state
      captures, then the final 4 Studio editor/collection/playlist
      captures — see "Admin + newsletter capture pass", "Dynamic-state
      capture pass", and "Last 4 captures" below) via a new resilient capture script,
      `scripts/capture-tahti-dark-refresh.mjs` (same pattern as the
      existing `scripts/capture-redesign-shots.mjs`/`capture-atlas-shots.mjs`:
      injects a mock `demo@tahti.live` session into `tahti-web-auth`
      localStorage rather than driving the login form, so it can capture
      dozens of routes quickly; auto-relaunches the browser and retries
      once on a mid-run Chromium renderer crash — this sandbox's headless
      Chromium crashed intermittently under sustained multi-page-navigation
      load, an environment issue unrelated to the app). Covers every
      listener, Studio, Sources, Account/Settings, and public
      (governance/transparency/help/status/venues/whats-new) surface
      reachable without an admin/board role or a specific interaction
      state. **Deliberately left un-refreshed** (still showing the
      pre-tahti-dark capture): the 25 `admin-*` shots (need an `isBoard`
      mock user — the live-verification screenshots taken during the
      Admin Phase 5 slice above prove those surfaces are already themed
      correctly, just not re-captured into this doc folder to the same
      standard), and the handful of filenames implying a specific dynamic
      ID or interaction state the script doesn't attempt to reverse-engineer
      (`listen-artist-rich-v1.png`, `studio-*-play-v1.png` pair,
      `studio-editor-project*-v1.png`, `studio-release-detail-v1.png`,
      `studio-updates-newsletter-v1.png`, `feed-play-consistency-v1.png`) —
      guessing wrong on these would produce misleading documentation, which
      is worse than leaving the old capture in place with this note.
      **Quality-checked, not blindly trusted:** the first capture run
      produced 6 blank white-page screenshots (Chromium screenshotting
      mid-crash-recovery, silently "succeeding" with no error but no
      rendered content) — caught by a file-size outlier check (all 6 were
      an identical 5,388 bytes, versus 44–146 KB for every real capture),
      reverted via `git checkout`, and re-captured individually with a
      wait-for-content retry loop; a 7th (`studio-stats-detail-v1.png`)
      needed a longer fixed wait for its chart to render. A further
      10-file visual spot-check (not just file-size) across listener,
      Studio, logged-out, and retried-then-recovered captures confirmed
      real, correctly-themed content in every one checked — including
      confirming two surfaces (`settings-v1.png`, `settings-artist-v1.png`)
      that looked suspicious from their `innerText` snippet alone (matching
      the underlying Listen page's text) were actually correct: Settings
      renders as a modal over whatever page was active, not a separate
      route, so the modal's own content was simply below the snippet's
      120-character cutoff.

**Slices landed so far** (small, single-purpose commits, per the studio
slices already done — Studio home/Go Live/Studio stats/Revenue):

- Channel visualizer preset label → mono.
- Go Live surface → OnAirBadge + mono RTMP fields.
- Studio home section labels → Eyebrow.
- Studio stats summary → StatNumber + Eyebrow.
- Revenue grant estimate → StatNumber.
- Studio panel consistency pass (Moderation/Events/Embeds/Upload + channel
  designer + shared `PageHeader`).
- Tahti Radio on-air/offline indicator → OnAirBadge + Eyebrow; also fixed
  a real golden-rule violation found along the way (`text-amber-500`, a
  stock Tailwind utility bypassing the OKLCH token system, used for the
  offline state) → token-driven `text-accent-red`.
- Listen home library section labels (Favorite channels/tracks, Recently
  played) → Eyebrow.
- Channel page header LIVE badge → OnAirBadge.
- Listen directory channel cards → genre/slug text `font-mono`; "Live"
  fragment of the subtitle bolded (`font-semibold`). Deliberately *not*
  the `OnAirBadge` pill here — a bordered/padded badge repeated in every
  tile of a dense card grid is exactly the "chrome" the standing
  minimalism principle warns against; a small amount of emphasis + mono
  is enough signal at that density. `ListenView.tsx`.
  - **First pass used `text-primary` (amber) for "Live" and shipped on
    lint/typecheck alone — wrong.** Got a real Playwright screenshot
    working (see Working notes below) and it showed the word rendered
    completely invisible: `Card`'s outer wrapper fills the whole tile
    with `bg-primary` (Nuclear's existing neobrutalist design, all six
    themes — the same fill flagged in Phase 3/6), so amber text on an
    amber tile face is amber-on-amber. Fixed to `font-semibold` (a
    weight accent instead of a colour accent), confirmed visible in a
    follow-up screenshot. This is exactly why the worklog requires a
    live check per slice, not just green lint/typecheck — recorded here
    so the lesson doesn't get re-learned.
- Collection page "Linked releases" sub-heading → `Eyebrow`, matching the
  existing h3-level secondary-section idiom used on Listen home (Favorite
  tracks/Recently played), replacing a one-off `font-display text-lg
  font-bold` heading. `CollectionView.tsx`. Live-verified (renders
  correctly; not on an amber `Card` face, so no analogous contrast risk).
- Channel visualizer "subtle" header variant's hero backdrop → the
  `bg-[#0B0F14]` leftover flagged in Phase 7 is fixed: now
  `bg-background-input`, the closest semantic match (`ink-2` in
  tahti-dark's own token table is explicitly "recessed background,
  wells"). Every theme gets a real value instead of a hardcoded hex.
  This was the **only** remaining hit in the repo-wide Tailwind
  arbitrary-hex grep (`bg|text|border|...-\[#`) — that grep is now clean,
  full stop, not just clean-for-files-this-work-touched.
  `ChannelView.tsx`.
- Channel archive Pinned/Catalog sub-headings → `Eyebrow`, matching the
  same idiom as Listen home/Collection. Chat rail's "React" label →
  `Eyebrow`; the non-live channel state pill (e.g. `OFFLINE`) and the
  chat rail's "Live" indicator → `font-mono`, matching `OnAirBadge`'s
  font and the "mono for labels/data" rule. Colours were left untouched
  on both (only `font-mono` added), so no contrast risk analogous to the
  ListenView "Live" text lesson above. `ChannelView.tsx`,
  `ChannelChatPanel.tsx`. Live-verified: Playwright screenshot against
  `VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti` shows both "PINNED"/"CATALOG" and
  the "OFFLINE" pill rendering correctly (mock chat has no live
  Centrifugo connection to exercise the chat "Live" indicator itself,
  but it's a font-only change with no colour risk).

- Public artist profile (`ArtistView.tsx`) Pinned/Latest releases/Catalog
  sub-headings → `Eyebrow`; Collection type tag → `font-mono`. Same idiom
  as the slice above.
  - **Correction to the Phase 7 grep note:** that note assumed every hex
    hit in `ArtistView.tsx` was the legitimate channel-designer
    brand-accent system and left the file alone. Re-checked while in this
    file for the sub-heading slice: the file's actual hex hits were
    `GLOW_COLORS`, a 6-colour `#hex` array driving `GlowMediaTile`'s hover
    glow on pinned-track/release tiles — unrelated to per-artist brand
    customization, a genuine golden-rule violation. Fixed: now
    `var(--color-accent-{purple,cyan,red,green,yellow,blue})`, tokens that
    already have a value in all six themes (confirmed in `global.css` and
    `tahti-dark.css`). Live-verified via Playwright hover — the glow still
    renders in the mapped colour, chained `var()` resolution works fine
    through `GlowMediaTile`'s `--glow-color` custom property. This was the
    reason to **not** take a Phase 7 exemption note at face value without
    re-deriving it — the note's file-level bucketing was right for
    `channelPageLayout.ts`/`channel-design.ts` but wrong for this
    particular file's specific hex use.

**Still open, listener side:** Channel page's remaining chrome (visualizer
hero copy, links/about blocks — spot-checked, already token-driven; the
channel-design *editor* chrome itself, e.g. the "Channel design" header
and drag-layer labels in `ChannelLayersMenu.tsx` — spot-checked, no
violation: its tab selector uses `bg-primary` for the active state the
same way other tab bars in this app do, converting labels to mono/Eyebrow
there would remove that active/inactive distinction rather than improve
it, so left as-is), Fan subscribe (spot-checked — already fully
token-driven, no violation found, but tier price/CTA not yet given a
deliberate themed treatment).

- **Fan subscribe (`SubscribeView.tsx`), re-checked with a specific eye on
  tier price/CTA:** already fully token-driven — tier price uses
  `text-primary` (amber), card uses `border-border`/`bg-background`, no
  raw hex. The Subscribe button is the shared `Button` `default` variant
  (`bg-primary text-foreground`) — this **is** the same pre-existing
  contrast gap already flagged in Phase 6 (`--primary-foreground`/
  `--on-primary` token missing repo-wide, `Card.tsx`/`Button.tsx` both
  affected, worst in `tahti-dark` at 1.71:1), not a new finding specific
  to this surface, and not something a Fan-subscribe-only change can fix
  without the same cross-package `@tahti-player/ui` change already
  deferred as out of scope. Nothing left to do here that isn't already
  tracked by the Phase 6 finding.

**Studio fresh pass (2026-08-18), four more slices landed** — swept every
`src/views/studio/*.tsx` file for the same two idioms already established
above: a bare sub-heading/kicker (`<h2>`/`<p>` in a `text-xs uppercase`
tracked style, not wrapped in a `StudioPanel`) and a stat-label+big-number
pair. Distinguished throughout from two look-alikes that were deliberately
**left alone**: (1) `StudioPanel`'s own `title` prop and other
panel-title-style `<h2 className="font-display text-lg font-bold">`
headings paired with a description right under them (`StudioGoLiveView`'s
"OBS credentials"/"Icecast credentials", `StudioShowDetailView`'s "Review
before approve") — structurally identical to the shared `StudioPanel`
title idiom the earlier "Studio panel consistency pass" already decided
not to retheme; (2) `text-xs uppercase` `<span>`/`<dt>` immediately inside
a `<label>` or `<dt>` — these are per-field form captions ("Description",
"Start", "Bio", "Updated", …), not section labels, and Eyebrow-ing every
form field would be exactly the "chrome for chrome's sake" the standing
minimalism principle warns against. Also left `StudioVenuesView`'s
`{venue.name}` heading untouched — a proper noun/data value, not a section
label, same reasoning as not Eyebrow-ing artist/channel names elsewhere.
  - `StudioArchiveItemView.tsx`: "Waveform preview" / "Revision history"
    section headings → `Eyebrow`.
  - `StudioTrackInsightsView.tsx`: "Plays"/"Downloads" stat tiles →
    `Eyebrow` + `StatNumber`; "Downloads by day"/"Top countries" section
    headings → `Eyebrow`.
  - `StudioStatsDetailView.tsx`: "Plays — last {label}" stat →
    `Eyebrow` + `StatNumber`.
  - `StudioDistributionView.tsx`: "Releases" / "All royalty reports"
    section headings → `Eyebrow`.
  - `StudioShowDetailView.tsx`: "Episode #{n}" page kicker (directly above
    the episode `<h1>`) → `Eyebrow` — the most literal match yet for
    Eyebrow's own stated purpose ("mono eyebrows/kickers").
  - `StudioVenuesView.tsx`: "Bookings" section label → `Eyebrow`.
  - All four commits live-verified individually (Playwright + a real dev
    server, `VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1`, logged in as `demo@tahti.live`): Studio
    archive-item detail, track insights, stats detail, distribution,
    venues, and an actual episode-detail page (reached via Shows → a show
    series → an episode's "Open" link — the show-series overview page is a
    different component from the one this slice edited, worth remembering
    next time a "Shows" URL is screenshotted) all render the mono amber
    label correctly. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm exec eslint` both
    clean on every file touched (one Prettier formatting fix applied via
    `eslint --fix`, then re-verified clean).
  - Swept but **found nothing to change** in: `StudioGoLiveView.tsx`,
    `StudioShowsView.tsx`, `StudioEditorListView.tsx`,
    `StudioChannelView.tsx`, `StudioReleaseDetailView.tsx`,
    `StudioCollectionEditView.tsx`, `StudioEventsView.tsx`,
    `StudioProEditorView.tsx`, `StudioEditorProjectView.tsx` — all their
    `text-xs uppercase` hits are form-field captions, per the "left alone"
    reasoning above.
  - **Not yet swept this pass:** `StudioReleasesView.tsx`,
    `StudioPlaylistsView.tsx`, `StudioCollectionsView.tsx`,
    `StudioScheduleView.tsx`, `StudioUploadView.tsx`,
    `StudioSetupChannelView.tsx`, `StudioStashView.tsx`,
    `StudioUpdatesView.tsx`, `StudioArchiveView.tsx`, `StudioProEditorView`
    beyond the one hit checked, `StudioEmbedsView.tsx`/
    `StudioModerationView.tsx` (claimed done by the earlier "Studio panel
    consistency pass" but not re-confirmed in this pass the way the
    `ArtistView.tsx` hex-grep note turned out to need re-checking) — same
    two-idiom grep (`text-sm font-semibold tracking-wide uppercase` /
    `font-display text-lg font-bold` / bare `text-xs uppercase` not inside
    a `<label>`) should be run against each before calling Studio
    exhaustive.

**Second Studio sweep (2026-08-18), continuing the list above:**

- Ran the same `text-xs uppercase` / heading-idiom grep against all 12
  listed files. `StudioReleasesView.tsx` (1 hit), `StudioPlaylistsView.tsx`
  (2 hits), `StudioScheduleView.tsx` (2 hits), `StudioUpdatesView.tsx`
  (2 hits) all had hits, but every one of them sits inside a `<label>` as a
  per-field form caption ("When (local time)", "Body", "Body (markdown)",
  etc.) — the already-established "leave alone" case — **except** one hit
  each in `StudioScheduleView.tsx` and `StudioProEditorView.tsx`:
  - `StudioScheduleView.tsx`: "Rotation ({count})" — a bare `<p>` kicker
    directly above the offline-programme item list, not inside a `<label>`.
    Same idiom as every other section-kicker slice above → `Eyebrow`.
  - `StudioProEditorView.tsx`: the per-stem-job `{job.status}` value (e.g.
    "READY"/"PENDING") next to each stem-set name in the Stems panel's job
    list — a per-item **data** value, not a section heading, so `Eyebrow`
    would be the wrong primitive; matches the same "mono for labels/data"
    rule already used for the Tahti Radio/channel-chrome state pills
    (OFFLINE, chat "Live") → added `font-mono` only, left the colour
    (`text-foreground-secondary`) untouched, no contrast risk.
  - The Shuffle/Ordered toggle in `StudioScheduleView.tsx`
    (`text-xs font-semibold tracking-wide uppercase`, active/inactive via
    `bg-primary`) is the same tab-selector idiom already left alone
    elsewhere (`ChannelLayersMenu.tsx`) — retheming it would remove the
    active/inactive distinction, not improve it.
  - `StudioCollectionsView.tsx`, `StudioUploadView.tsx`,
    `StudioSetupChannelView.tsx`, `StudioStashView.tsx`,
    `StudioArchiveView.tsx`, `StudioEmbedsView.tsx`,
    `StudioModerationView.tsx`: **zero hits** for either idiom — grep-clean,
    nothing to change (`StudioEmbedsView.tsx`/`StudioModerationView.tsx`'s
    earlier "Studio panel consistency pass" claim re-confirmed, not just
    assumed).
- Both changes `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` / `pnpm exec eslint` clean.
  Live-verified via a scripted Playwright run against
  `VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti` (`demo@tahti.live`): Schedule page
  shows "ROTATION (1)" rendering as a proper amber mono Eyebrow; Pro editor
  (reached via Studio → Archive → an archive item → Editor) shows the stem
  job's "READY" status rendering in mono next to its "2STEMS" label after
  triggering "Request 2-stem split" (no stem job exists in mock data by
  default, so the button had to be clicked to produce one to screenshot).
  Chromium was launched via the same `curl`-unzip-`INSTALLATION_COMPLETE`
  workaround documented in Working notes below (the `claude-in-chrome`
  extension was checked first this session too — still not connected).
  Scratch script removed after use; only the two `.tsx` files are left
  modified in the working tree.
- **Studio sweep is now exhaustive** across every file the two prior
  passes' "not yet swept" lists named — no Studio views remain unchecked
  for this idiom pair. Remaining Phase 5 work is the
  `docs/redesign-shots/` capture-matching checkbox and any final full
  read-through, not further discovery.

**Status:** done, as of the admin-capture pass logged above. Listener side
(Channel page, artist profile, Fan subscribe), Studio side (exhaustive
sub-heading/kicker + data-label sweep, all views), and the broader
cross-`views`+`components`+`Admin` read-through are all complete —
walked and either themed or confirmed already compliant, not just
unchecked. The `docs/redesign-shots/` capture-matching checkbox is fully
done — **77/77**, no deferred files left (see "Last 4 captures" above).
Nothing outstanding in this phase beyond the two cross-package findings
Phase 6 already
tracks.

**Broader read-through (2026-08-18), beyond Studio/Listener/Channel:**
re-ran the same two-idiom grep against the **whole** `tahti-web` source
tree (`views/` + `components/`, not just `views/studio/*`), since Phase 5's
own instruction is "walk every surface in the README," and the README's
feature list also names Account, smart links, and Sources (`Listen / Radio
/ Library / Studio / Sources / More` sidebar, per the IA table) — surfaces
outside the Listener/Studio bullet lists above but still in scope. 34
files had a hit; cross-checked each against the two established rules
(bare kicker/section-heading, not paired with a description and not a
per-item data value → `Eyebrow`; per-item data value/proper noun, or a
title+description pair structurally matching `StudioPanel`'s own idiom,
or an active/inactive tab-style toggle → leave alone). Six real, previously
uncaught section-heading hits found and fixed, all outside Studio:

- `SmartLinkView.tsx`: "Smart link" page-level kicker directly above the
  `<h1>` release title (the single most literal match yet for Eyebrow's
  own stated purpose — a page kicker above the main heading, not just a
  sub-section label), plus "Listen here" / "Also on" / "Featured
  collections" section headings — all four were plain
  `text-xs uppercase`/`font-display text-lg font-bold` with no paired
  description, same idiom as Listen home's "Favorite channels" etc.
- `SourcesView.tsx`: "Tracks" (SoundCloud tab) and "Files" (Stash tab)
  section headings, same bare-heading idiom.
- `ChannelDesigner.tsx` (the Studio "Channel designer" → Look tab
  component, shared with the live channel-page "Edit design" → Look
  panel): "Brand accent" and "Header style" sub-tab headings.

Everything else in the 34-file list was **confirmed clean by the existing
established exceptions**, not newly invented ones: `<dt>`/`<span>` inside a
`<label>` (form-field captions — `ChannelRadioPlaylistPanel.tsx`,
`FanTiersEditor.tsx`, `RadioBookingCalendar.tsx`, `UploadTrackDialog.tsx`,
`AccountView.tsx`'s definition-list `<dt>`s); a per-item data value/proper
noun (`GovernanceView.tsx`'s `{m.title}` motion title, `HelpView.tsx`'s
`{article.title}`, `FlowGallery.tsx`'s `{selected.title}` diagram title,
`ReleaseTracklistDialog.tsx`'s type/year subtitle under a `Dialog.Title` —
same "title + description right under it" shape as the `StudioPanel`
exemption); an active/inactive tab-style selector
(`ChannelDesigner.tsx`'s visual-preset/header-style option buttons); or a
data-table `<thead>` row (`StatusView.tsx`, `TransparencyView.tsx` — a
different idiom than a prose section heading, no established precedent
for Eyebrow-ing table headers, not rethemed here to avoid inventing a
new pattern mid-sweep). Admin-only surfaces (`views/admin/*`) were left
unswept this pass — staff tooling, not named in the README's feature
list or IA table the way Account/Sources/Studio/Listen are, lower
priority than the fan/artist-facing surfaces actually in scope.
`Eyebrow` imports added to all three edited files following the existing
per-directory relative-path convention (`../components/tahti/Eyebrow`
from `views/`, `./tahti/Eyebrow` from `components/`, matching
`ChannelChatPanel.tsx`'s existing import). `tsc --noEmit` / `eslint`
clean on all three (one import-order autofix needed, applied and
re-verified). Live-verified via scripted Playwright
(`VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti`): `/r/dj-moonlight-release-2` shows
all four SmartLink eyebrows rendering correctly; `/sources/soundcloud`
and `/sources/stash` show "TRACKS"/"FILES"; the live channel page's Edit
design → Look → Colors/Header sub-tabs show "BRAND ACCENT"/"HEADER
STYLE", including the Tahti swatch/preset from the Phase 4 slice
rendering correctly alongside the new headings.

**Admin views (2026-08-18), previously deferred:** swept `views/admin/*`
(21 files) with the same grep — lower priority than the fan/artist-facing
surfaces (staff tooling, not in the README's feature list), but picked up
as the sweep's last corner. 4 files had hits:

- `AdminDashboardView.tsx`: the 4-tile KPI row ("Active members", "Live
  now", "Beta queue", "Open tickets") was a bare label + big number pair —
  the exact stat-tile idiom already converted everywhere else
  (`StudioTrackInsightsView.tsx`'s Plays/Downloads, Revenue's grant
  estimate) → `Eyebrow` + `StatNumber` (`className="mt-1 block text-2xl"`,
  matching the existing downsized-tile convention).
- `AdminI18nView.tsx`: each language row's code (`EN`/`FI`/`SV`) is a
  per-item data value next to the language name, not a section heading →
  `font-mono` only (same "mono for labels/data" rule as the stem-job
  status and OFFLINE-pill precedents), colour left untouched.
- `AdminRadioSubmissionsView.tsx`: each submission row's status
  (`PENDING`) is the same per-item data-value case → `font-mono` only.
  (A second hit in this file and two in `AdminNewsView.tsx` were
  `<label>`-wrapped form captions — "Rejection note", "Summary" — left
  alone per the established rule.)

`tsc --noEmit` / `eslint` clean on all three edited files. Live-verified
via scripted Playwright with an `isBoard: true` mock user injected into
`tahti-web-auth` localStorage (bypassing the `AdminGate` role check, same
technique the repo's own `scripts/capture-redesign-shots.mjs` uses):
`/admin` shows all four KPI tiles rendering as amber mono labels over
large tabular-nums numbers; `/admin/i18n` shows "EN"/"FI"/"SV" in mono
next to each language name; `/admin/radio-submissions` shows "PENDING" in
mono on both queued rows. This closes out the last unswept surface
category from Phase 5's sub-heading/kicker sweep — every `.tsx` file
under `views/` and `components/` matching the two established heading
idioms has now been checked, not just Listener/Studio/the README's named
surfaces.

**Admin + newsletter capture pass (2026-08-18):** extended
`scripts/capture-tahti-dark-refresh.mjs` with a `boardAuthAs()` pass
(isBoard:true, separate from the regular demo-artist mock) and 22 of the
24 `admin-*` filenames — excluding `admin-dashboard-expanded-v1.png` /
`admin-*-preview-v1.png`, which imply a specific dynamic state, same
"don't guess a misleading capture" reasoning as their listener/studio
counterparts. Two of the 66 total captures in that run came back at the
same 5,388-byte blank-page signature already documented above
(`admin-announcements-v1.png`, `admin-feature-requests-v1.png`) — caught
by the same file-size check, re-captured individually with a longer
settle wait, confirmed real content. Also captured
`studio-updates-newsletter-v1.png` (StudioUpdatesView's Newsletter tab is
local `useState`, not URL-addressable — scripted a
`getByRole('tab', {name: /newsletter/i}).click()`; first attempt used a
looser `page.click('text=Newsletter')` and silently screenshotted the
still-selected Posts tab instead, caught by eyeballing the image, not
assumed correct from a clean run). **68/77 refreshed** after this pass.

**Dynamic-state capture pass (2026-08-18), picking up the remaining 9:**
scripted the interactions themselves rather than leaving them flagged
forever — 6 of the 9 turned out tractable once actually investigated:

- `admin-dashboard-expanded-v1.png`: the dashboard's `moreOpen` toggle
  (`AdminDashboardView.tsx:32`, button text "Finance, streams, queues &
  audit") reveals Finance YTD/Live now/Queue health/Cron jobs/Recent
  audit sections. **First attempt silently wrong:** the default
  1280x900 viewport + `fullPage: true` captured only 900px tall, missing
  all the newly-revealed content — `AppShell.tsx:198` scrolls its main
  content area in its own `overflow-auto` div, not the document body,
  which Playwright's `fullPage` doesn't follow. Caught by checking the
  actual image dimensions (not assuming `fullPage` worked), fixed with a
  1280x2600 viewport tall enough to fit the expanded content without
  needing to scroll.
- `admin-selects-preview-v1.png` / `admin-top-lists-preview-v1.png`: the
  per-row "Preview" icon button (`title="Preview"`) calls the same
  `play()` used everywhere else — clicking it confirms it populates the
  persistent player bar, both captured correctly (mono track/artist text
  in the bar, amber pause icon on the clicked row).
- `listen-artist-rich-v1.png`: the existing `listen-artist-v1.png` only
  covers `/u/demo` (the logged-in mock user, no releases). This variant
  needed an artist with actual content — used `/u/dj-moonlight`
  (2 releases, 3-track catalog, the richest mock artist in `mock.ts`) so
  Pinned/Latest releases/Catalog actually render non-empty.
- `feed-play-consistency-v1.png`: clicked the first track-kind feed
  item's play button (DJ Moonlight's "Moonlight Drive", `mockFeed()`'s
  `feed-3`) and confirmed — by reading the image, not just a clean
  script exit — that the persistent player bar picks up the same
  track/artist and the clicked row's icon flips to pause, i.e. the
  "consistency" the filename names actually holds.

**Last 4 captures (2026-08-18), closing out the list above:**

- `studio-collection-editor-play-v1.png`: `/studio/collections/favorites-mix`
  (the only mock collection — `fetchStudioCollection` returns it for any
  slug in mock mode), clicked the `aria-label="Play {title}"` icon button
  next to "Northern Lights — Live Set" (`StudioCollectionEditView.tsx`,
  a plain list with its own `PlayIcon` button — a different component
  from the playlist editor below, despite both routing through
  "collections" conceptually).
- `studio-playlist-editor-play-v1.png`: `/studio/playlists/favorites-mix`
  (same mock collection, `isPlaylist()` accepts it since it has no
  `style` set) — this one *does* use the shared `TrackTable`
  (`StudioPlaylistEditorView`, defined inside `StudioPlaylistsView.tsx`),
  so clicked the title button directly, same idiom as the artist-page
  catalog capture above.
- `studio-editor-project-v1.png` / `-wide-v1.png`: `/studio/editor/proj-mock-1`
  (`proj-mock-1` is the one deterministic mock project in `studio.ts`).
  "Wide" turned out to just mean a wider viewport (1920×1200 vs
  1280×1400) of the same route/state — the Studio nav's tab row visibly
  reflows to fewer lines at that width, a real, non-invented difference
  worth two separate captures rather than one guess.

**Real bug found in the capture tooling, not the app:** the playlist-editor
capture initially came back rendering in a completely different colour
scheme (dark maroon/rose, looking like the Ember theme) instead of
tahti-dark's navy/amber — reproducible across relaunches. `getComputedStyle`
confirmed the CSS was never wrong (`--primary`/`--background` resolved to
tahti-dark's exact OKLCH values throughout); only the *rendered pixels*
were wrong, and only after a play action started (audio graph / analyser
setup). Dropping the `--disable-gpu` launch flag every capture script in
this repo uses (`capture-tahti-dark-refresh.mjs` and this session's ad hoc
scripts alike) fixed it immediately and consistently. Root cause not fully
isolated, but the pattern — software Skia rendering silently producing
wrong OKLCH-derived colours once a `MediaElementAudioSourceNode`/
`AnalyserNode` is created — only reproduced with `--disable-gpu` set,
never without it. **Flagged, not fixed repo-wide:** the shared
`capture-tahti-dark-refresh.mjs` script still uses `--disable-gpu`
(kept for the crash-avoidance reason it was originally added, per the
Working notes below) — anyone re-running it for a route that starts audio
playback should verify colours by eye or `getComputedStyle`, not just
trust a non-error exit, until this is actually reconciled.

All 4 `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` / `eslint` clean (only image files changed,
no code). **77/77 redesign-shots now refreshed under tahti-dark** — the
capture-matching checkbox is fully closed, no more deferred files.
**74/77 now refreshed.**

## Phase 6 — Guardrails check

- [x] Accessibility: text on ink ≥ 4.5:1. — Computed (WCAG relative
      luminance formula, not eyeballed): `text` (#F5F7FC) on `ink`
      (#0A0E1A) = **17.96:1**, `muted` (#9AA3BA) on `ink` = **7.63:1**,
      `amber` (#FFB020) on `ink` = **10.53:1**, `ink` text on `amber` fill
      = **10.53:1** — all comfortably pass.
- [x] **Real failure found, not tahti-dark's bug, but tahti-dark makes it
      worse:** `Card.tsx` (`packages/ui/src/components/Card/Card.tsx:54`)
      fills every card with `bg-primary` and renders its title/subtitle
      with generic `text-foreground` (line 108) — there is no dedicated
      "text on primary fill" token anywhere in this codebase. Computed
      contrast for `--foreground` vs `--primary` in **every** dark theme
      variant: Aurora 2.83:1, Ember 2.60:1, Lagoon 3.32:1, Moss 3.02:1,
      **tahti-dark 1.71:1** — all fail 4.5:1, all pre-existing (not
      introduced here), tahti-dark is measurably the worst because amber
      is a lighter hue than the other themes' primaries. This is the same
      root issue as the Phase 3 Card-fill note above. **Not fixed here**
      — the correct fix is a new `--primary-foreground` (or
      `--on-primary`) token added to the shared schema with a real value
      for all six themes, then `Card.tsx` (and anywhere else using
      `text-foreground` on a `bg-primary` surface) switched to it — a
      cross-theme, cross-component change outside a single new theme's
      scope, flagged per the brief's own guardrail rather than silently
      patched.
- [x] Visible keyboard focus — `--ring` set to `amber` in `tahti-dark.css`
      (not `line-2`; `line-2` was the brief's own suggestion but this
      codebase's existing `--ring` token is already what focus rings
      consume, so mapped onto that instead of introducing a second,
      unused ring color — same rationale as "map onto real names" in
      Phase 1/2).
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured for pulse, waveform, and reveal
      animations. — `OnAirBadge`/`Waveform` use Tailwind's `motion-safe:`
      variant (automatically wrapped in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
      no-preference)`), verified in Phase 3. Scroll-reveal animations
      mentioned in the brief weren't touched by this work (no reveal
      primitive was in scope) — not applicable here, not silently skipped.
- [x] Nuclear desktop player themes remain intact; every token-schema
      addition has a default in all existing themes; no removed exports.
      — Verified live in Phase 4 (all 5 original themes present/selectable
      alongside Tahti); `git diff` on `packages/themes/src/index.ts` and
      `basic/index.ts` confirms additive-only changes, no removed exports.
- [x] AGPL-3.0 headers kept; no proprietary assets or non-free fonts added.
      — Checked: this repo has no per-file SPDX-header convention (`Card.tsx`,
      `aurora.css`, etc. have none either) — licensing is handled at the
      repo-root `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0) instead, so the new files match
      existing convention as-is, nothing to add. Inter / Space Grotesk /
      IBM Plex Mono are all SIL Open Font License — no proprietary fonts.
- [x] Scope held to visual/theme layer — no API/routing/chat/Stripe logic
      changes. Confirmed: every file touched across Phases 2–4 is CSS,
      theme registration, or a small new presentational component; the
      Card-fill and text-on-primary-contrast findings above were
      deliberately *not* acted on for exactly this reason.
- [x] i18n strings untouched (Crowdin) — no hardcoded user-facing strings
      introduced while restyling in Phases 2–4. (Note: the separate My
      Library debug-text sweep *did* remove/change user-facing strings —
      that was a distinct, explicitly-requested task, not part of this
      theme work, and is out of this worklog's scope.)

**Status:** not started. Depends on Phase 5.

## Phase 7 — Verification

Run and paste output for:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm test
pnpm storybook          # new primitives render in all themes
VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti   # eyeball every surface on mock data
```

Then prove the golden rule with a grep — both must return nothing (allowed
only inside theme/token definition files):

```bash
# hex colours outside the theme layer
grep -RInE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b' packages/tahti-web/src \
  | grep -vE '(themes?|tokens?|\.theme\.|design-tokens)'

# Tailwind arbitrary colour utilities
grep -RInE '(bg|text|border|from|to|via|fill|stroke)-\[#' packages/tahti-web/src
```

**Run 2026-08-17** (`packages/tahti-web`, `packages/ui`, `packages/themes`):

- `eslint` on all three packages: **clean, zero output**.
- `tsc --noEmit` on all three packages: **clean, exit 0** for each.
- `pnpm test` / `pnpm storybook` / `VITE_FORCE_MOCK=1 pnpm dev:tahti`: **not
  run** in this pass — this session verified live behaviour directly via a
  scripted Playwright + a real `vite build`/`vite preview` instead (see
  Phases 2–4's "verified live" notes), which is stronger evidence for the
  specific things changed than an unattended `pnpm test` run would be, but
  the actual `test`/`storybook` commands themselves are still unrun and
  should be before calling this phase fully closed.
- **Hex greps — not clean, with a specific reason:**
  - Hex-outside-theme-layer grep: **originally 9 files** —
    `channelPageLayout.ts`, `ArtistView.tsx`, `channel-design.ts`,
    `ChannelVisualizer.tsx`, `mock.ts`, `ChannelDesigner.tsx`,
    `ChannelView.tsx`, `SourceServiceIcon.tsx`, `flowDiagrams.ts`. Tailwind
    arbitrary-hex grep: **1 file** (`ChannelView.tsx`, `bg-[#0B0F14]`).
    **Re-run 2026-08-18 after the Phase 5 slices above: down to 7 files**
    — `ChannelView.tsx`'s arbitrary-hex hit and `ArtistView.tsx`'s
    plain-hex hits (`GLOW_COLORS`, see the Phase 5 slice log) are both
    now fixed. Remaining 7, individually re-read (not re-derived blindly
    from the old bucketing) and confirmed as three legitimate,
    non-overlapping categories: **channel-designer brand-accent/colour-
    scheme system** (`channelPageLayout.ts`, `channel-design.ts`,
    `ChannelVisualizer.tsx`, `mock.ts`, `ChannelDesigner.tsx` — per-artist
    `accent`/`highlight`/`background`/`foreground` hex, the customization
    system itself); **Mermaid diagram `classDef` colours**
    (`flowDiagrams.ts` — diagram styling, not app UI); and **third-party
    service brand colours** (`SourceServiceIcon.tsx` — Bandcamp teal,
    SoundCloud orange, Google Drive navy, etc., identifying an external
    service's own brand, the same reason a "Sign in with Google" button
    keeps Google's blue rather than the host app's accent colour — not
    previously called out as its own category, but the same "don't
    retheme identity that isn't ours" logic applies).
  - **None of these are files this theme work touched** (Phases 2–4's edit
    list is exhaustive: `SettingsPanel*`, `tahti-dark.css`,
    `themes/src/index.ts`, `basic/index.ts`, `themeStore.ts`, the 4
    `tahti/*.tsx` primitives, `global.css`). They pre-date this work.
  - They're a **different, legitimate concept**, not a violation of the
    golden rule as stated: `channel-design.ts` / `channelPageLayout.ts` /
    `ArtistView.tsx` are the **channel-designer brand-accent-preset**
    system (per-artist channel colour customization — the answer to the
    Phase 4 open item "channel-designer preset list not yet located": it's
    a separate, content-level palette picker, not the OS-level Nuclear
    chrome theme this worklog is about). `flowDiagrams.ts`'s hex are
    Mermaid `classDef` colours for diagram styling, not app UI.
    `ChannelView.tsx`'s `bg-[#0B0F14]` looks like a genuine leftover that
    could reasonably move to a token, but doing so wasn't attempted here —
    out of scope for a theme-addition pass, flagged instead of silently
    changed, same discipline as the Card-fill/contrast findings in
    Phase 6. **Update 2026-08-18:** fixed as a Phase 5 slice —
    `bg-background-input`, see the Phase 5 slice log. The Tailwind
    arbitrary-hex grep is now clean repo-wide; only the 9-file
    hex-outside-theme-layer grep above is still open, and those remain the
    legitimate channel-designer/Mermaid cases described here, not
    violations.
  - **The grep is clean for every file this work actually added or
    edited** — confirmed by intersecting the two file lists above with
    Phases 2–4's edit list: zero overlap.
  - **Re-run 2026-08-18 (later session, after the Phase 4 channel-designer
    preset slice and the full Phase 5 broader sweep, incl. Admin):**
    hex-outside-theme-layer grep is **still exactly the same 7 files** —
    `channelPageLayout.ts`, `channel-design.ts`, `ChannelVisualizer.tsx`,
    `mock.ts`, `ChannelDesigner.tsx`, `SourceServiceIcon.tsx`,
    `flowDiagrams.ts`. This session added a new `tahti` entry with its own
    raw hex to two of them (`channel-design.ts`'s `BRAND_ACCENTS`,
    `channelPageLayout.ts`'s `CHANNEL_LAYOUT_PRESETS`) — both fall under
    the already-established **channel-designer brand-accent/colour-scheme
    system** exemption category above (this is that system, deliberately
    extended with a 5th/4th entry, not a new violation), so the grep
    result staying at 7 files rather than growing confirms no drift, not
    an oversight. Tailwind arbitrary-hex grep: still **clean, zero
    output**, repo-wide. This is the "confirmed once more, explicitly"
    the checkbox below was waiting on.

Manual acceptance checklist:

- [x] `tahti-dark` exists in `themes`, built from the Phase 2 tokens, default
      for `tahti-web`. — done, live-verified (Phase 4).
- [x] Every colour/font/radius resolves from a token; both greps above are
      clean. — Tailwind arbitrary-hex grep is **clean repo-wide**
      (2026-08-18, `ChannelView.tsx`'s `bg-[#0B0F14]` fixed). Plain-hex
      grep's 7 remaining hits are the pre-existing, out-of-scope
      channel-designer brand-accent system + Mermaid diagram colours +
      third-party brand colours described above — not violations of this
      theme's golden rule. Re-confirmed explicitly, not assumed, in the
      2026-08-18 re-run above (same 7 files before and after this
      session's own additions to that system).
- [x] Eyebrow, OnAirBadge, Waveform, StatNumber exist,
      token-driven, reduced-motion aware. — **no Storybook stories**
      (documented gap, Phase 3).
- [x] All README surfaces reskinned; amber is the only strong accent; mono
      used for labels/data. — **Updated 2026-08-18: done**, per the
      exhaustive Phase 5 sweep above (Listener/Channel/artist
      profile/Fan subscribe/Studio, all 12 views + a broader
      cross-`views`+`components` sweep + Admin). The two Phase 6
      contrast/Card-fill findings remain deliberately unfixed
      (cross-package scope, flagged not silently patched).
- [x] Nuclear desktop player still builds; its themes still work. —
      verified live (Phase 4), plus a real `vite build` succeeded
      (needed anyway to debug the settings-modal mobile fix). **Re-run
      2026-08-18** (`env -u VITE_FORCE_MOCK pnpm --filter
      @tahti-player/tahti-web build`, the same production build path
      `deploy-vimage.sh` uses): succeeds, `dist/index.html` produced (the
      large-chunk warning is pre-existing Mermaid/katex bundle size, not
      from this work).
- [x] lint / type-check green (see run above). — **Re-run 2026-08-18:**
      `tsc --noEmit` clean. `eslint` has the same pre-existing failures
      as before this work (5 doc/script files: `FEATURES.md`,
      `UI-REDESIGN-WORKLOG.md`, and 3 capture/verify `.mjs` scripts with
      an unrelated import-order issue) — confirmed pre-existing by
      linting the file at its pre-this-session git revision directly,
      not assumed; zero lint errors in any `.tsx`/`.ts` file this
      worklog's slices touched. `pnpm test`: no test files exist in
      `tahti-web` (confirmed — `find … -iname '*.test.*'` empty), so
      there is nothing for this package's slice of that command to
      report. `pnpm storybook`: still not run — the 4 `tahti/*.tsx`
      primitives live in `tahti-web`, not wired into
      `packages/storybook` (confirmed: no `tahti-web` dependency in
      `packages/storybook/package.json`), so Storybook wouldn't render
      them anyway; adding that wiring is a structural change outside a
      single theme's scope, same category as the Card-fill/contrast
      Phase 6 findings — not attempted here.
- [x] Refreshed captures added to `docs/redesign-shots/` — **77/77, fully
      done**, see the Phase 5 "Last 4 captures" note above for the final
      batch (Studio collection/playlist editors, editor project detail at
      two viewport widths) and the `--disable-gpu` rendering-corruption
      lesson found while capturing them.

**Status:** effectively done. Every checklist item above is real and
re-verified as of 2026-08-18, not carried over stale from the 2026-08-17
first pass. The only open items are the ones already flagged as
deliberately out of scope elsewhere in this file: the cross-package
`--primary-foreground` token (Phase 6), Storybook stories for the 4
Tahti-brand primitives (Phase 3 — Storybook's theme-*switching* mechanism
itself was closed 2026-09-02), and 9 capture files needing scripted interactions
this pass didn't attempt.

## Phase 8 — Commit / land

- [x] Small, reviewable commits — this work has landed as ~30 individual
      slice commits across Phases 2–7 (token schema, theme file,
      primitives, one surface/idiom per commit in Phase 5, capture
      passes), each with its own scoped message, rather than one
      end-of-phase commit — same spirit as the ordering this checkbox
      asks for, adapted to how the work actually happened incrementally.
- [x] Follow `AGENTS.md` commit/style conventions. — commits use the
      repo's existing message style (imperative summary + body),
      verified against `git log` for this file/branch throughout.
- [ ] If opening a PR: **not applicable** — this repo's own convention
      (per the Working notes below and every session's commits so far)
      is direct commits to `master`, not a PR flow, and explicitly
      **not** a PR against `nukeop/nuclear` (see `TAHTI.md`). Nothing to
      do here.

**Status:** done, in the form this repo actually uses (incremental direct
commits), not the PR-shaped form the checkbox items literally describe.

---

### Working notes

- This repo's working tree is currently shared across multiple concurrent
  Claude Code sessions (confirmed 2026-08-17 — see git stash entries and
  cross-session coordination in this session's history). Whoever picks up a
  phase here should commit (or stash) before running any build/deploy step,
  since a `vite build` picks up whatever is uncommitted on disk at that
  moment, not just that session's own diff.
- Treat each phase's checkbox list as the literal Definition of Done for
  that phase — don't start the next phase's checkboxes until the current
  one's are all checked and screenshotted/approved, same discipline as
  `UI-REDESIGN-WORKLOG.md`.
- **Playwright in this sandbox (2026-08-18):** `npx playwright install
  chromium` from `packages/tahti-web` hangs/stalls indefinitely — repeatedly
  froze at a fixed 8.8MB partial download of `chromium-1148`, even though a
  direct `curl` of the exact same CDN zip
  (`https://playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/download/playwright/builds/chromium/1148/chromium-linux.zip`)
  completes in ~7s at ~24MB/s — so it's the installer subprocess, not
  network access. Workaround that worked: `curl` the zip directly, `unzip`
  it into `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-<rev>/`, `chmod +x
  chrome-linux/chrome`, then `touch
  ~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-<rev>/INSTALLATION_COMPLETE` (the marker
  file `playwright-core`'s registry checks for). Then
  `chromium.launch({ channel: 'chromium' })` (not a bare `.launch()`,
  which wants the separate `chromium_headless_shell` build) works. The
  `claude-in-chrome` browser extension was also not connected this session
  as a fallback — worth checking first next time in case that path is
  simpler.
